# CIFAR-10-Classifier-Using-TensorFlow_Keras
In this notebook, I build a CIFAR-10 CNN classifier using TensorFlow and Keras. I also introduce Data Augmentation to make the model less prone to over-fit and attain overall better generalization using ImageDataGenerator module from Keras Image Preprocessing Sub-Library.

I would appreciate any leads on increasing my model performance.
Thanks!
